This sudoku takes input one by one cell , you have to enter 9 * 9 matrix .
press 0 where cell is empty , otherwise each time the code asks you to enter row with col . 

here is the example of a 9 * 9 matrix , supposing we enter 0 always.

   col  col  col col col col col col col
            1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
row 1 ->    0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
